We use neuronal oscillations to investigate interactions within speech
motor networks in a paradigm of speech motor adaptation under
altered feedback with continuous recording of EEG in which subjects
adapted to the real-time auditory perturbation of a target vowel sound.
As subjects adapted to the task, concurrent changes were observed in
the theta-gamma phase coherence during speech planning at several
distinct scalp regions that is consistent with the establishment of a
feedforward map.
